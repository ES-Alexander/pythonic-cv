        'filename' The video file to write to.
        'fourcc' the "four character code" representing the writing codec.
            Can be a four character string, or an int as returned by
            cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc. As functioning combinations of file
            extension + codec can be difficult to find, the helper method
            VideoWriter.suggested_codec is provided, accepting a filename
            (or file extension) and a list of previously tried codecs that
            didn't work and should be excluded. Suggested codecs are populated
            from VideoWriter.SUGGESTED_CODECS, if you wish to view the
            suggested options directly.
        'fps' is the framerate (frames per second) to save as. It is a constant
            float, and can only be set on initialisation. To have a video that
            plays back faster than the recording stream, set the framerate to
            higher than the input framerate. The VideoWriter.from_camera
            factory function is provided to create a video-writer directly
            from a camera instance, and allows measuring of the input framerate
            for accurate output results if desired.
        'frameSize' is the size of the input frames as a tuple of (rows, cols).
        'isColor' is a boolean specifying if the saved images are coloured.
            Defaults to True. Set False for greyscale input streams.
        'apiPreference' allows specifying which API backend to use. It can be
            used to enforce a specific reader implementation if multiple are
            available (e.g. cv2.CAP_FFMPEG or cv2.CAP_GSTREAMER). Generally
            this is not required, and if left as None it is ignored.

            it can be an integer to select a connected camera, or a filename
            to open a video.
        'display' is used as the default window name when streaming. Defaults
            to 'frame'.
        'delay' is the integer millisecond delay applied between each iteration
            to enable windows to update. If set to None, this is skipped and
            the user must manually call waitKey to update windows.
            Default is None, which allows headless operation without
            unnecessary waiting.
        'quit' is an integer ordinal corresponding to a key which can be used
            to stop the iteration loop. Only applies if delay is not None.
            Default is ord('q'), so press the 'q' key to quit when iterating.
        'play_pause' is an integer ordinal corresponding to a key which can be
            used to pause and resume the iteration loop. Only applies if delay
            is not None. Default is ord(' '), so press space-bar to pause/
            resume when iterating.
        'pause_effects' is a dictionary of key ordinals and corresponding
            handler functions. The handler will be passed self as its only
            argument, which gives it access to the 'get' and 'set' methods,
            as well as the 'status' and 'image' properties from the last 'read'
            call. This can be useful for logging, selecting images for
            labelling, or temporary manual control of the event/read loop.
            Note that this is only used while paused, and does not get passed
            quit or play_pause key events.
        'play_commands' is the same as 'pause_effects' but operates instead
            while playback/streaming is occurring. For live processing,
            this can be used to change playback modes, or more generally for
            similar scenarios as 'pause_effects'.
        'destroy' destroys any specified windows on context exit. Can be 'all'
            to destroy all active opencv windows, a string of a specific window
            name, or a list of window names to close. If left as -1, destroys
            the window specified in 'display'.
        'source' is a class which acts like a video source, by implementing at
            minimum the methods 'get', 'set', 'read', 'grab', 'retrieve',
            'open', 'isOpened', and 'release'.

        For default key-bindings see 'auto_delay' details.

        'filename' is the string path of a video file. Depending on the file
            format some features may not be available.
        'start' and 'end' denote the respective times of playback, according
            to the specified fps. They can be integers of milliseconds, or
            strings of 'hours:minutes:seconds' (larger amounts can be left off
            if 0, e.g. '5:10.35' for no hours). If left as None, the video
            starts and ends at the first and last frames respectively.
            It is expected that 'start' < 'end', or playback ends immediately.
        'auto_delay' is a boolean specifying if the delay between frames should
            be automatically adjusted during playback to match the specified
            fps. Set to False if operating headless (not viewing the video), or
            if manual control is desired while iterating over the video.
              If set to False, sets 'destroy' to None if not otherwise set.
              If True enables playback control with 'w' increasing playback
            speed, 's' slowing it down, 'a' rewinding (only possible if
            'skip_frames' is True), and 'd' returning to forwards playback.
              The 'r' key can be pressed to reset to 1x speed and forwards
            direction playback. 'a' and 'd' can be used while paused to step
            back and forwards, regardless of skip_frames. 'b' can be used while
            playing or paused to jump the video back to its starting point.
            These defaults can be overridden using the 'play_commands' and
            'pause_effects' keyword arguments, supplying a dictionary of key
            ordinals that sets the desired behaviour. Note that the defaults
            are set internally, so to turn them off the dictionary must be
            used, with e.g. play_commands={ord('a'):lambda vid:None} to disable
            rewinding.
        'fps' is a float specifying the desired frames per second for playback.
            If left as None the fps is read from file, or if that fails is set
            to 25 by default. Value is ignored if 'auto_delay' is False.
        'skip_frames' allows frames to be manually set, as required by reverse
            or high speed playback. If left as None this is disallowed. If
            'auto_delay' is True, any integer value can be set (suggested 0),
            and the number of frames to skip at each iteration is determined
            as part of the delay tuning. If 'auto_delay' is False, an integer
            can be used as a consistent number of frames to skip at each
            iteration (e.g. only read every 10th frame). Note that enabling
            frame skipping can make playback jerky on devices and/or file
            formats with slow video frame setting times, and inconsistent
            skipping amounts with 'auto_delay' may cause issues with
            time-dependent processing.
        'verbose' is a boolean determining if status updates (e.g. initial fps,
            and playback speed and direction changes) are printed. Defaults to
            True.

        *args and **kwargs get passed up the inheritance chain, with notable
            keywords including the 'preprocess' and 'process' functions which
            take an image and return a processed result (see LockedCamera),
            the 'quit' and 'play_pause' key ordinals which are checked if
            'auto_delay' is True, and the 'play_commands' and 'pause_effects'
            dictionaries mapping key ordinals to desired functionality while
            playing and paused (see ContextualVideoCapture documentation for
            details).
